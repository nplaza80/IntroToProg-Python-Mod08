The program is a well-structured application designed to manage employee ratings data using object-oriented programming principles. It consists of multiple Python modules, each handling a specific aspect of the application. The data_classes.py module defines the core data structures, such as Person and Employee, encapsulating attributes and ensuring data consistency. The processing_classes.py module manages data persistence, including reading from and writing to JSON files, while the presentation_classes.py module handles user interaction, guiding the user through data entry and displaying information. Together, these modules ensure that the application is modular, maintainable, and easy to extend.

Automated testing is an integral part of the program, with unit tests provided in separate test modules for each key component. These tests validate the functionality of the program, ensuring that each module works as intended and that changes do not introduce new bugs. The program also uses a JSON file, EmployeeRatings.json, for data storage, enabling data persistence across sessions. Overall, the application demonstrates effective use of object-oriented design, separation of concerns, and automated testing to create a robust, user-friendly system for managing employee ratings.
